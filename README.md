## Acknowledgements
The Guardian API is the great resource supplying this news app. (https://open-platform.theguardian.com/)

Thanks to Google and Udacity for the opportunity to learn so much in so little time. I actually was excited to code this app for the course. I want to learn and code more!

A huge "thank you" to Heather. As a social media authority, she is an excellent resource for me to get ideas and feedback on my apps!

The idea behind this app was actually inspired by chance. In 2017, I happened upon a New Zealand cricket match on ESPN3. A new sport (for me) to learn! I was hooked. Since then I've learned the squad, most of the laws, strategies, etc.

The theme is inspired from the New Zealand All-of-Government Brand.

For example, their official typeface (Fira Sans) is used throughout this app.

Also, the app's colors are inspired from here.

Black, white, gray and the Māori red are all represented. Loved the red contrast so much so that I used it for the app's "colorAccent." Some info on the Māori flag.
